## Major Milestones:
 - Full GUI Implementation
 - Procedurally-Generated Terrain & GUI for customization of it
 - Gameplay essentials
 - Networking
 - Prototype Release & Updating

## Code Programming Principles
### GUI Element Writing
 - Question 1: Assess the requirements of GUIElement, take into account - ***purpose (behavior)***, ***data (structure)*** of the GUI Element, 
 - Question 2: Prepare the labeling conventions (how the methods; functions, variables, classes, and other symbols, are going to be named)
   - Names of the labels
   - Conventionality of the labels
 - Question 3: Prepare the requirements on markdown files, along with prepared labels
 - Question 4: Prepare the Acceptance Test for the GUIElements, with all required testing
 - Question 5: Prepare the algorithms to be implemented
   - Question 5.B: What is required from the GUIE, GUIA, GUIG, or D, A, or Game1 classes perspectives?
   - Question 5.B.2: If there is something, pre-list, pre-assess, and possibly implement
 - Question 6: Write down everything (speed typing)

## Progression (GUI)

1. 
 - Prepare all GUIElement Concepts
 - Prepare all assessments for them
 - Implement all acceptance tests for them
 - Implement its code (speed typing)

2.
 - Create GUI System
   - Main Menu
   - Editor
   - Game menu

## Progression (Procedurally Generated Map)

1. Prepare all GUI Elements before proceeding
2. Prepare (Assess requirements) the first prototype of the procedurally generated terrain
3. Prepare the conventions (similarly to GUI assessment)
4. Make sure all variables of the Procedurally Generated Terrain are in GUI System, Attach them
5. Connect everything before implementation of G class
6. Implement Acceptance Tests
7. Implement Procedurally Generated Map (G)
   a. Mathematical
   b. Random (Random, FastNoiseLite)
   c. Itself (Tile generation, Entity generation, Structure generation) 
   d. Tile, Entity, Structure Activity & Rendering

## Progression (Game1)

1. Assess all first prototype requirements (behavior [api], data [variables])
